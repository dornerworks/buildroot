# =====================================================================
# Example PV Linux guest configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# This is a fairly minimal example of what is required for a
# Paravirtualised Linux guest. For a more complete guide see xl.cfg(5)

# Guest name
name = "dom1"

# 128-bit UUID for the domain as a hexadecimal number.
# Use "uuidgen" to generate one if required.
# The default behavior is to generate a new UUID each time the guest is started.
#uuid = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Kernel image to boot
kernel = "/root/Dom1-Kernel"

# Ramdisk (optional)
#ramdisk = "/home/guests/Dom1FS.gz"

# Kernel command line options
extra = "console=hvc0 earlyprintk=xenboot root=/dev/xvda1 rw"

# Initial memory allocation (MB)
memory = 128

# Maximum memory (MB)
# If this is greater than `memory' then the slack will start ballooned
# (this assumes guest kernel support for ballooning)
#maxmem = 512

# Number of VCPUS
vcpus = 1

# Network devices
# A list of 'vifspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-network-configuration.markdown
vif = [ 'bridge=xenbr0' ]

# Disk Devices
# A list of `diskspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt
disk = [ 'phy:/dev/loop0,xvda,w' ]
